                    <p>Queen’s Vertical Farming team aims to design and build a low budget, low 

                        operating cost farm that can be used on the Queen’s campus in Kingston, Ontario. 
                        
                        The goal of this farm is to make vertical farming more accessible to more low-
                        
                        income communities to build more across Kingston and Ontario. QVFT aims to learn 
                        
                        efficient and economical growing techniques to better improve the plant quality and
                        
                        budget for vertical farming. The budget goal of this farm is less than $5000 which 
                        
                        all materials, nutrients and plants should be purchased below this threshold.

                    <h2>Muise Labs Vertical Farm </h2>
                    <p>In April 2021, the Queen’s Vertical Farming Team became partners with Professors 

                        Christian Muise and Professor Ting Hu. With this partnership, QVFT has designed a 
                        
                        vertical farm system comprising of 16 different zones where different plant or other 
                        
                        variables can be controlled to change the outcome of the plant growth. The vertical 
                        
                        farm system takes inspiration from other vertical farms in Canada and looks to 
                        
                        incorporate emerging technologies such as machine learning and artificial 
                        
                        intelligence to better grow various plants. This farm will act as a research hub for 
                        
                        the Muise Lab graduate students. </p>
